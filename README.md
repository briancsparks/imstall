# imstall

Use 'npx imstall ...' as a package installer for more complex installations.

## When You Can't Just `apt-get install...` Something

Many great software packages don't have properly-built packages for the
package managers out there. And, because of the nature of change, it is usually
the newest, most exciting software that hasn't yet put time into package-ifying
their code. Usually, there's only a readme.

So, I decided to build scripts for the ones I've had to install manually, and
here they are. These have been used on Ubuntu 16.04 only. If something fails on
it, leave me an issue. If it fails on 18.04 or 20.04, leave an issue, but it might
not get fixed right away. PRs are appreciated. PRs for non-Ubuntu are doubly
appreciated. (See below.)

## Adding Imstallers

When the user invokes: `npx imstall xyz`, the tool looks in its `.../lib/ubuntu/16.04/`
directory for an executable called `xyz`. If nothing is there, it looks in
`.../lib/ubuntu/` for `xyz`. If an `xyz` is found, it is executed.

* `ubuntu` was gotten from `lsb_release -is`.
* `16.04` was gotten from `lsb_release -rs`.

so, put a script at `.../lib/$(lsb_release -is)/$(lsb_release -rs)/xyz` for your favorite
software and send me a pull request.
